# **App Name**: FieldSense Agro

## Core Features:

- Mobile Field Activity & Resource Logging: Enable field workers to efficiently capture all production measures (e.g., tillage, seeding, fertilization, harvesting), associated labor time, machinery, and material inputs directly from mobile devices. This includes selecting fields via a map, detailing inputs, and recording notes.
- GIS-Enabled Observation & Damage Documentation: Provide tools for geo-referenced documentation of field observations, crop growth stages (BBCH), and damages, allowing users to mark specific points or polygons on a map and attach photos and descriptive notes.
- Automated Fuel & Cost Attribution: Automatically calculate and attribute fuel consumption and related costs to specific field activities and machinery based on recorded operating times/hectares and current fuel prices from master data.
- Integrated Machine Maintenance & Repair: Manage machine master data, set up rule-based maintenance schedules with automated notifications for overdue tasks, and meticulously track all repair events, including materials, labor, costs, and downtime.
- Comprehensive Performance Analytics: Generate dashboards and reports that provide transparent insights into full costs and contribution margins (Deckungsbeitrag) per field and crop, analyze labor hours, fuel usage, and machinery costs, allowing for year-over-year comparisons.
- Field Data Import & Mapping: Facilitate the import of existing GIS-based field boundaries from Shapefile or GeoJSON formats. Display these fields on an interactive map for visual context during data input and for overlaying observation data.
- Secure Access & Offline Data Sync: Implement robust role-based access control to differentiate user permissions across various modules and ensure essential offline data entry capabilities for seamless operation in areas with limited connectivity, with automatic synchronization upon regaining connection.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A robust, rich green (#27A343), embodying growth, vitality, and agricultural productivity. Chosen to signify health and efficiency without being overly literal.
- Background color: A very light, subtle green-grey (#ECF5ED), ensuring a clean and airy feel that prioritizes content legibility, particularly for data and map elements in a light scheme.
- Accent color: A vibrant yellow-green (#84E019), serving as a lively contrast to draw attention to critical actions, positive indicators, and interactive elements, symbolizing dynamic insights and fresh growth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), selected for its clear legibility, modern aesthetic, and versatility across different screen sizes and text densities, crucial for both data input on mobile and detailed reports on desktop.
- Utilize a consistent set of clean, line-based icons for all agricultural activities, machine types, map functionalities, and status indicators. Icons should be easily discernible on mobile screens to enhance quick navigation and understanding.
- Emphasize a mobile-first, card-based layout for data entry and daily tasks, ensuring quick input within 15-20 seconds per standard action. Desktop views will leverage flexible grid systems for dashboards and detailed tabular reports, featuring integrated map visualizations for GIS data.
- Incorporate subtle, functional animations for feedback on successful data submissions, loading states for reports and map views, and smooth transitions between interface elements to enhance perceived performance and user experience.
